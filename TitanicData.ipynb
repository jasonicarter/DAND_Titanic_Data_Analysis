    "\"One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\" -  https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "What factors made people more likely to survive?\n",
    "1. **Were social-economic standing a factor in survival rate?**\n",
    "2. **Did age, regardless of sex, determine your chances of survival?**\n",
    "3. **Did women and children have preference to lifeboats (survival)?**\n",
    "4. **Did women with children have a better survival rate vs women without children (adults 18+)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption:** We are going to assume that everyone who survived made it to a life boat and it wasn't by chance or luck."

It's a bit surprising that more children didn't survive but this could possibly be attributed to the mis-representation of what age is considered as the cut off for adults - i.e. if in the 1900's someone 15-17 were considered adults, they would not have been \"saved\" under the \"women and children first\" idea and would be made to fend for themselves. That would in turn, change the outcome of the above data and possible increase the number of children who survived."

    "\n",
    "The results of the analysis, although tentative, would appear to indicate that class and sex, namely, being a female with upper social-economic standing (first class), would give one the best chance of survival when the tragedy occurred on the Titanic. Age did not seem to be a major factor. While being a man in third class, gave one the lowest chance of survival. Women and children, across all classes, tend to have a higher survival rate than men in genernal but by no means did being a child or woman guarentee survival. Although, overall, children accompanied by parents (or nannies) had the best survival rate at over 50%. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues:**\n",
    "- A portion of men and women did not have Age data and were removed from calculations which could have skewed some numbers\n",
    "- The category of 'children' was assumed to be anyone under the age of 18, using today's North American standard for adulthood which was certainly not the case in the 1900s"
